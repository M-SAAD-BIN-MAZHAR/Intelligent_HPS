       "AIMessage(content=' The theory of relativity is a scientific explanation of how the physical world works, put forward by Albert Einstein, that challenges our everyday notion of space and time. It consists of two parts: Special Relativity (SR) and General Relativity (GR).\\n\\nSpecial Relativity (SR), published in 1905, focuses on objects moving at constant speeds relative to each other in a straight line. It introduced two groundbreaking concepts:\\n\\n1. The Principle of Relativity: The laws of physics are the same in all inertial (non-accelerating) frames of reference.\\n \\n2. The Constancy of the Speed of Light: The speed of light in a vacuum, approximately 273,400 kilometers per hour (170,000 miles per hour), is always the same for all observers, regardless of their motion or the motion of the source of light.\\n\\nGeneral Relativity (GR), published in 1915, is a theory of gravitation. It can be explained as follows: Massive objects like planets and stars cause a \"curvature\" in spacetime, which is felt as gravity. So, instead of being an attractive force between two objects, gravity is considered a distortion in the geometry of space and time.\\n\\nOne simple way to remember SR is by thinking that everything appears the same to all observers moving at constant speeds relative to each other. And, the speed of light has always been constant, no matter how fast the observer or the light source is moving. For GR, imagine a large rubber sheet representing spacetime. Massive objects, like planets, create indentations on the sheet, causing other objects to move along curved paths. This curvature is felt as gravitational force.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 376, 'prompt_tokens': 16, 'total_tokens': 392}, 'model_name': 'mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2', 'system_fingerprint': '', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--5baa194b-4dba-4053-9ad1-13d932a6e502-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 16, 'output_tokens': 376, 'total_tokens': 392})"
